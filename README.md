# Linear Regression with one variable to predict the profit based on population 
## The code is divided into several parts :
* Read and plot the data.
* Separate the data into training and testing. 
* Convert from data frames to numpy matrices.
* implement the cost function and GradientDescent function. 
* Draw the line of regression.
* Draw error graph between iteration and cost.
